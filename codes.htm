        <h3>A C# codes for a Crowdsourcing Experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk</h3>
        <p>
            Given that running a relatively large experiment was not possible manually, we wrote a C# codes to take care of it (the code is located <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/asudeh/codes/tree/master/MechanicalTurk">here</a>).<br/>
            We used AMT API for C#. It has been tried to put many useful functions in the base class ("MyMTClass"), so that those can easily be adjusted and reused later.
            Just as a short comment, remember to set the proper values for "MechanicalTurk.AccessKeyId" and "MechanicalTurk.SecretAccessKey" in "app.config". Moreover, please note that need to acivate line 14 and comment line 15 in "app.config" for the sandbox envronment (you need to do the vice verse for the prod environment).
            I mention some of the useful functions of the basic class here (understanding the code, and other classes/functions should be easy).
            <ul>
                <li>The function "SurveyHitfromHTML" generates a hit from an HTML content. Please note that the HTML content shoould have a specific structure. The files "test.htm" and "PicCompTemplate.htm" are two samples that you can use as refrence. <br />
</li>
                <li>The function "SurveyHitfromFolder" takes all the HTML files in a given folder, and generated a HIT for each of them.</li>
                <li>"CollectAllResults" is in charge of collecting the HitResponses, for all HITs, and generate the corresponding data-file. Please note that this function is written for a specific experiment and needs to be adjusted for other exoeriments.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>A WSN Discrete Event Simulator</h3>
        <p>
            The Discrete Event Simulator (in C++), written for Simulating the MAC protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks is located <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/asudeh/codes/tree/master/MACSim">here</a>.<br />
            The class "EngineQ" is the core class for implementing a discerte event simulator, contains a queue of events/event-times, and handles the ocurance of events.
            The general classes such as sensor "node" and "network" are located in the file "general.h".
            "eventHandler" is a middle class, which takes care of connecting the MAC protocols with the lower layers, by generating the messages and selecting the corrent MAC protocol functions.
            "SMAC", "TSMP", and "PreambleBased" are the current sets of MAC protocols.

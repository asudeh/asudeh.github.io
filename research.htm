            Many web databases are "hidden" behind proprietary search interfaces
            that enforce the top-k output constraint, i.e., each query returns
            at most k of all matching tuples, preferentially selected and
            returned according to a proprietary ranking function. <i>In this paper,
            we initiate research into the novel problem of skyline discovery
            over top-k hidden web databases</i>. Since skyline tuples provide critical
            insights into the database and include the top-ranked tuple for
            every possible ranking function following the monotonic order of
            attribute values, skyline discovery from a hidden web database can
            enable a wide variety of innovative third-party applications over
            one or multiple web databases.
        </p>
        <p>
            In one other paper, we define a novel query re-ranking problem, i.e., a third-party service that uses nothing but the public search interface of a client-server database to enable the on-the-fly processing of queries with user-specified ranking functions (with or without selection conditions), no matter if the ranking function is supported by the database or not.

		    This is the first study on crowdsourcing Pareto-optimal object finding, which has applications in public opinion collection, group decision making, and information exploration. Departing from prior studies on crowdsourcing skyline and ranking queries, it considers the case where objects do not have explicit attributes and preference relations on objects are strict partial orders. The partial orders are derived by aggregating crowdsourcers' responses to pairwise comparison questions. The goal is to find all Pareto-optimal objects by the fewest possible questions. It employs an iterative question-selection framework. Guided by the principle of eagerly identifying non-Pareto optimal objects, the framework only chooses candidate questions which must satisfy three conditions. This design is both sufficient and efficient, as it is proven to find a short terminal question sequence. The framework is further steered by two ideas---macro-ordering and micro-ordering. By different micro-ordering heuristics, the framework is instantiated into several algorithms with varying power in pruning questions. Experiment results using both real crowdsourcing marketplace and simulations exhibited not only orders of magnitude reductions in questions when compared with a brute-force approach, but also close-to-optimal performance from the most efficient instantiation.

		    Users and developers are tapping into big, complex entity graphs for numerous applications. It is challenging to select entity graphs for a particular need, given abundant datasets from many sources and the oftentimes scarce information available for them. We propose methods to automatically produce preview tables for entity graphs, for compact presentation of important entity types and relationships. The preview tables assist users in attaining a quick and rough preview of the data. They can be shown in a limited display space for a user to browse and explore, before she decides to spend time and resources to fetch and investigate the complete dataset. We formulate several optimization problems that look for previews with the highest scores according to intuitive goodness measures, under various constraints on preview size and distance between preview tables. The optimization problem under distance constraint is NP-hard. We design a dynamic-programming algorithm and an Apriori-style algorithm for finding optimal previews. The experiments and user studies on Freebase demonstrated both the scoring measures' accuracy and the discovery algorithms' efficiency.

            Abolfazl Asudeh, <a target="_blank" href="http://crystal.uta.edu/~zaruba/">Gergely V. Zaruba1</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajal_K._Das">Sajal K. Das</a><br>
		    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being deployed for different applications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence should be tuned to the applications. However, there is no for selecting MAC protocols for different situations. Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is good for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on the other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols in the same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to introduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given requirements from the category that performs better for a given context. We define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance of different categories protocols for different contexts. Having the general model, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols, categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energy consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we focus on deriving mathematical models for them. The results extracted from CPF are the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols that verifies our model. We validate our models with the help of simulation study. We also implemented the current CPF model in a web page to make the model <a target="_blank" href="http://crystal.uta.edu/~zaruba/MAC/GemMACs.htm">online</a> and useful.

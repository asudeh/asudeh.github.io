							Finding the maxima of a database based on a user preference, especially when the ranking function is a linear combination of the attributes, has been the subject of recent research. A critical observation is that the convex hull is the subset of tuples that can be used to find the maxima of any linear function. However, in real world applications the convex hull can be a significant portion of the database, and thus its performance is greatly reduced. Thus, computing a subset limited to r tuples that minimizes the regret ratio (a measure of the user’s dissatisfaction with the result from the limited set versus the one from the entire database) is of interest. In this paper, we make several fundamental theoretical as well as practical advances in developing such a compact set. In the case of two dimensional databases, we develop an optimal linearithmic time algorithm by leveraging the ordering of skyline tuples. In the case of higher dimensions, the problem is known to be NP-complete. As one of our main results of this paper, we develop an approximation algorithm that runs in linearithmic time and guarantees a regret ratio, within any arbitrarily small user-controllable distance from the optimal regret ratio. The comprehensive set of experiments on both synthetic and publicly available real datasets confirm the efficiency, quality of output, and scalability of our proposed algorithms.

							Many web databases are "hidden" behind proprietary search interfaces that enforce the top-k output constraint, i.e., each query returns at most k of all matching tuples, preferentially selected and returned according to a proprietary ranking function.
							<i>In this paper, we initiate research into the novel problem of skyline discovery over top-k hidden web databases</i>. Since skyline tuples provide critical insights into the database and include the top-ranked tuple for every possible ranking function following the monotonic order of attribute values, skyline discovery from a hidden web database can enable a wide variety of innovative third-party applications over one or multiple web databases.

			The ranked retrieval model has rapidly become the de facto way for search query processing in client-server databases, especially those on the web. Despite of the extensive efforts in the database community on designing better ranking functions/mechanisms, many such databases in practice still fail to address the diverse and sometimes contradicting preferences of users on tuple ranking, perhaps (at least partially) due to the lack of expertise and/or motivation for the database owner to design truly effective ranking functions. This paper takes a different route on addressing the issue by defining a novel query reranking problem, i.e., we aim to design a thirdparty service that uses nothing but the public search interface of a client-server database to enable the on-the-fly processing of queries with any user-specified ranking functions (with or without selection conditions), no matter if the ranking function is supported by the database or not. We analyze the worst-case complexity of the problem and introduce a number of ideas, e.g., on-the-fly indexing, domination detection and virtual tuple pruning, to reduce the average-case cost of the query reranking algorithm. We also present extensive experimental results on real-world datasets, in both offline and live online systems, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques.

							Platforms such as AirBnB, Zillow, Yelp, and related sites have transformed the way we search for accommodation, restaurants, etc. The underlying datasets in such applications have numerous attributes that are mostly Boolean or Categorical. Discovering the skyline of such datasets over a subset of attributes would identify entries that stand out while enabling numerous applications.

							<i>Abolfazl Asudeh</i>, Azade Nazi, Nick Koudas, Gautam Das.
							<br><b>ArXiv e-prints 1705.03028</b><br/>
							Peer to peer marketplaces enable transactional exchange of services directly between people. In such platforms, those providing a service are faced with various choices. For example in travel peer to peer marketplaces, although some amenities (attributes) in a property are fixed, others are relatively flexible and can be provided without significant effort. Providing an attribute is usually associated with a cost. Naturally, different sets of attributes may have a different “gains” (monetary or otherwise) for a service provider. Consequently, given a limited budget, deciding which attributes to offer is challenging. In this project, we propose techniques that help service providers in decision making.

			This is the first study on crowdsourcing Pareto-optimal object finding, which has applications in public opinion collection, group decision making, and information exploration. Departing from prior studies on crowdsourcing skyline and ranking queries, it considers the case where objects do not have explicit attributes and preference relations on objects are strict partial orders. The partial orders are derived by aggregating crowdsourcers' responses to pairwise comparison questions. The goal is to find all Pareto-optimal objects by the fewest possible questions. It employs an iterative question-selection framework. Guided by the principle of eagerly identifying non-Pareto optimal objects, the framework only chooses candidate questions which must satisfy three conditions. This design is both sufficient and efficient, as it is proven to find a short terminal question sequence. The framework is further steered by two ideas---macro-ordering and micro-ordering. By different micro-ordering heuristics, the framework is instantiated into several algorithms with varying power in pruning questions. Experiment results using both real crowdsourcing marketplace and simulations exhibited not only orders of magnitude reductions in questions when compared with a brute-force approach, but also close-to-optimal performance from the most efficient instantiation.

		    Users and developers are tapping into big, complex entity graphs for numerous applications. It is challenging to select entity graphs for a particular need, given abundant datasets from many sources and the oftentimes scarce information available for them. We propose methods to automatically produce preview tables for entity graphs, for compact presentation of important entity types and relationships. The preview tables assist users in attaining a quick and rough preview of the data. They can be shown in a limited display space for a user to browse and explore, before she decides to spend time and resources to fetch and investigate the complete dataset. We formulate several optimization problems that look for previews with the highest scores according to intuitive goodness measures, under various constraints on preview size and distance between preview tables. The optimization problem under distance constraint is NP-hard. We design a dynamic-programming algorithm and an Apriori-style algorithm for finding optimal previews. The experiments and user studies on Freebase demonstrated both the scoring measures' accuracy and the discovery algorithms' efficiency.

		    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being deployed for different applications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence should be tuned to the applications. However, there is no for selecting MAC protocols for different situations. Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is good for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on the other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols in the same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to introduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given requirements from the category that performs better for a given context. We define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance of different categories protocols for different contexts. Having the general model, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols, categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energy consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we focus on deriving mathematical models for them. The results extracted from CPF are the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols that verifies our model. We validate our models with the help of simulation study. We also implemented the current CPF model in a web page to make the model <a target="_blank" href="http://crystal.uta.edu/~zaruba/MAC/GemMACs.htm">online</a> and useful.

        <h1>Open Position Announcement</h1>
<div class="contentBox">
    <p>
    I have openings for (up to) 3 Ph.D. students, 1 master's student, and 1 undergrad student.
    Please read the following requirements carefully and if you're qualified and interested,
    email your CV (only in PDF format) to asudeh AT uic.edu with the following subject:
    (i) current students: "UIC Student Interested to Join", (ii) future students: "PhD Applicant Interested to Join".
    </p> 
    <h3>Focus:</h3>       
    <p>
        I believe that brainstorming is the key to solving problems and that "good" research is teamwork, in opposed to individuals' effort.
        To achieve this, I am constantly looking for enthusiastic students, to build a strong collaborative team.
        My theme for the project teams is as following:
        <ul>
            <li><i>Project Lead:</i> The main student (the first name in the list of authors): responsible for moving the project ahead, organizing the meetings, coming up with ideas/solutions, leading the experiments and writing.</li>
            <li><i>Another student:</i> helping the project lead. The two students will meet several times in a week, brainstorm about the project, getting ready for the weekly team meeting.</li>
            <li><i>Internal/External Collaborator:</i> a faculty or a senior researcher.</li>
            <li><i>Advisor:</i> I will be the advisor.</li>
            <li><i>Additional members:</i> as needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I do research to develop tools that help human being in conducting data-driven tasks and to design algorithms that ever-growing big data,
        while considering socital impacts.
        Consider the pipeline of research from the problem identification, 
        technical research (includeing problem formulation, algorithm design, and experiments), 
        and developing proper tools (and potentially integration into existing technologies).
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>PhD Students/Applicants:</i>  In this pipeline of research, I try to maintain a collection of interesting problems we discover as we do research.
        I understand that problem identification needs a lot of experience, which usually is beyond the expertise of fresh grad students.
        I consider it my responsibility to come up with a project that is on the interest of the lead student.
        Next is team formation: the junior students will have a mentor (usually a senior student) to help them in the project they lead.
        Besides me, there will be (at least) another collaborator (an internal or external faculty or researcher) to help expand the visibility and network of the student.
        We will have weekly team meetings within which we brainstorm about the project. I expect following this method, an enthusiastic student will have a productive and happy
        academic life, which is my goal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Master (and Undergrad) Students:</i> A major step in the pipeline of research is to transform research results into useful tools. Although this will be less technical-heavy, 
            it, still, will require a good amount of engineering and development. This will be (at least) in the form of demonstration applications of the research papers -- known as demos.
            You will be responsible for the development of these tools (with the help of me and a (possibly) a PhD student).
            While there often will be a demo, following a technical research, sometime we will implement preliminary demos to envision a major future project having a high impact.
            Either way, I expect there will be at least one demo submission for each project, which (at least) will be a strong component of your CV.

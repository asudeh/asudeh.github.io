            <h5 class="card-title">Research Focus:</h5>
            My research spans to different aspects of Big Data and Data Science, including data management, analytics, and mining, for which I aim to find efficient, accurate, and scalable algorithmic solutions.
            <u>Responsible data science and algorithmic fairness</u> is my current research focus.
            I also work/am-interested-in projects related to <u>ranking and representatives, data management for ML, web databases, social networks, knowledge graphs, computational fact checking, etc</u>.
            Please refer to my <a href="projects.htm">projects</a> and <a href="pub.htm">publications</a> for my current and past research.

            <h5 class="card-title">Research Theme:</h5>
            I believe that brainstorming is the key to solving problems and that "good" research is teamwork, in opposed to individuals' effort.
            To achieve this, I constantly look to hire enthusiastic students to build a strong collaborative team.
            My theme for the research teams is as following:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Project Lead:</i> The main student (the first name in the list of authors): responsible for moving the project ahead, organizing the meetings, coming up with ideas/solutions, conducting the experiments, and the (first draft of) writing.</li>
                <li><i>Another student:</i> helping the project lead. The two students will meet several times a week and brainstorm about the project, getting ready for the weekly team meetings.</li>
                <li><i>Internal/External Collaborator:</i> a faculty or a senior researcher.</li>
                <li><i>Advisor:</i> I will be the advisor.</li>
                <li><i>Additional members:</i> as needed.</li>
            </ul>

                I maintain a collection of interesting problems we discover as we do research. 
                I understand that problem identification needs a lot of experience, which usually is beyond the expertise of fresh grad students.
                I consider it my responsibility to come up with projects that are of the interest of the lead student. 
                Next is team formation: junior students will have a mentor (usually a senior student) to help them in the project they lead.
                Besides, there will be (at least) another collaborator (an internal or external faculty or researcher) to help expand the visibility and the network of the student.
                We will have weekly team meetings within which we will brainstorm about the project. I expect following this method, an enthusiastic student will have a productive and happy academic life, which is my goal.

                A major step in the pipeline of research is to transform research results into useful tools. Although this will be less research-heavy, 
                it, still, will require a good amount of engineering and development. 
                I expect the results to be (at least) in the form of demonstrating applications of the research papers -- known as demos.
                You will be responsible for the development of these tools (with the help of me and (possibly) a PhD student).
                While there often will be a demo made based on an already published research paper, 
                sometimes we will implement preliminary demos to envision a major future project.
                Either way, I expect there will be at least one demo submission for each project, which (at least) will be a strong component of your CV.

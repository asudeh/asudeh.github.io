		Project: <a target="_blank" href="http://pinpoint.microsoft.com">Microsoft Pinpoint </a> Telemetry<br/>
		Position: Developer.<br/>
		Company Branch: Commerce Platform - Seller Services.<br/>
		Microsoft Pinpoint is a customer to partner assignment service, which is used to suggest the partners to customers and provides special services for partners (e.g. each partner can have several profiles in different languages). The new version of the product was presented at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalwpc.com/WPC2014/Pages/WPC-2014.aspx">WPC 2014</a>.<br>
		The main objective of my project was to create the infrastructures and the architecture for the telemetry instrumentation on Microsoft Pinpoint.
		Here is the list of major contributions of my project:
		<ul>
		<li>We designed/updated a Telemetry Architecture that can capture (but is not limited to) client-side, server side, and DB events.</li>
		<li>We designed and implemented the pull-based "LogRecorder" as a central component for collecting the KPI logs from remote machines.</li>
		<li>Enabled a third-party service for client-side monitoring.</li>
		<li>We <b>proved the Architecture</b> by successfully testing and deploying LogRecorder on prod environment, not just for this project (Pinpoint), but also by other branches of Microsoft Commerce branch.</li>
		<li>We delivered all highlighted KPIs and all the codes; their set ups are working properly in the prod environment and data are collected in Microsoft cloud environment.</li>
		<li>We created the basic reports for collected KPIs.</li>
		</ul>
		I had very good summer interning at the Seller Services branch of Microsoft Commerce Platform. I drove from Arlington, TX to Seattle, WA and visited a lot of cool places during the trip. Still, I believe Seattle was one of the most beautiful places. I will later provide a report for my trip here.<br>
		About the team that I joined, I have to say I have been so lucky. All the people in the team were cool, nice and very friendly. I definitely could not finish the project without their vital helps, especially when things were getting complicated by "company policies".<br>
		To make the story short, it definitely was one of my best summers and here are the two most important messages I learnt:
		<ul>
		<li>Work with the team pace.</li>
		<li>Change the direction as soon as you got blocked.</li>

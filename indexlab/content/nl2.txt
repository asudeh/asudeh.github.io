		Algorithmic decisions often result in scoring and ranking individuals
		to determine credit worthiness, qualifications for college
		admissions and employment, and compatibility as dating partners.
		While automatic and seemingly objective, ranking algorithms can
		discriminate against individuals and protected groups, and exhibit
		low diversity. Furthermore, ranked results are often unstable —
		small changes in the input data or in the ranking methodology may
		lead to drastic changes in the output, making the result uninformative
		and easy to manipulate. Similar concerns apply in cases
		where items other than individuals are ranked, including colleges,
		academic departments, or products.
		<br>
		In this demonstration we present Ranking Facts, a Web-based
		application that generates a “nutritional label” for rankings. Ranking
		Facts is made up of a collection of visual widgets that implement
		our latest research results on fairness, stability, and transparency for
		rankings, and that communicate details of the ranking methodology,
		or of the output, to the end user. We will showcase Ranking Facts
		on real datasets from different domains, including college rankings,
		criminal risk assessment, and financial services.

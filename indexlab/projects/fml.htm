        Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to make decisions in our society. ML models, however, can be unfair to certain demographic groups (e.g., African Americans or females) according to various fairness metrics. Existing techniques for producing fair ML models either are limited to the type of fairness constraints they can handle (e.g., preprocessing) or require nontrivial modifications to downstream ML training algorithms (e.g., in-processing).
        We propose a declarative system OmniFair for supporting group fairness in ML. OmniFair features a declarative interface for users to specify desired group fairness constraints and supports all commonly used group fairness notions, including statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. OmniFair is also model-agnostic in the sense that it does not require modifications to a chosen ML algorithm. OmniFair also supports enforcing multiple user declared fairness constraints simultaneously while most previous techniques cannot. The algorithms in OmniFair maximize model accuracy while meeting the specified fairness constraints, and their efficiency is optimized based on the theoretically provable monotonicity property regarding the trade-off between accuracy and fairness that is unique to our system.
        We conduct experiments on commonly used datasets that exhibit bias against minority groups in the fairness literature. We show that OmniFair is more versatile than existing algorithmic fairness approaches in terms of both supported fairness constraints and downstream ML models. OmniFair reduces the accuracy loss by up to <code>94.8%</code> compared with the second best method. OmniFair also achieves similar running time to preprocessing methods, and is up to <code>270x</code> faster than in-processing methods.

            Machine learning (ML) algorithms, in particular classification algorithms, are increasingly being used to aid decision making in every corner of society. There are growing concerns that these ML algorithms may exhibit various biases against certain groups of individuals. For example, some ML algorithms are shown to have bias against African Americans in predicting recidivism, in  NYPD stop-and-frisk decisions, and in granting loans.
            Similarly, some are shown to have bias against women in job screening and in online advertising. ML algorithms can be biased primarily because the training data these algorithms rely on may be biased, often due to the way the training data are collected.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Due to the severe societal impacts of biased ML algorithms, various research communities are investing significant efforts in the general area of fairness --- two out of five best papers in the premier ML conference ICML 2018 are on algorithmic fairness, the best paper in the premier database conference SIGMOD 2019 is also on fairness, and even a new conference ACM FAccT (previously FAT*) dedicated to the topic has been started since 2017.  
            One commonly cited reason for such an explosion of efforts is the lack of an agreed mathematical definition of a fair classifier. As such, many different fairness metrics have been proposed to determine how fair a classifier is with respect to a ``protected group'' of individuals (e.g., African-American or female) compared with other groups (e.g., Caucasian or male), including statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. 
            </p>
            <p> <bf>Key Components of our work:</bf>
            In light of the many current and constantly increasing types of fairness constraints and the drawbacks of existing approaches, we develop OMINFAIR. A comparison between OMINFAIR and existing approaches is shown in the following:</p>

                <i>1. Declarative Group Fairness.</i> Current algorithmic fairness techniques are mostly designed for particular types of group fairness constraint. In particular, preprocessing techniques often only handle statistical parity. While  in-processing techniques generally support more types of constraints, they often require significant changes to the model training process. OMNIFAIR is able to support all the commonly used group fairness constraints. In addition, OMNIFAIR features a declarative interface that allows users to supply  future  customized fairness metrics. As shown in the following figure, a fairness specification in OMNIFAIR is a triplet (g, f, epsilon) with three components: (1) a grouping function g to specify demographic groups; (2) a fairness_metric function f to specify the fairness metric to compare between different groups; and (3) a value epsilon to specify the maximum disparity allowance between groups.
                Given a dataset D, a chosen ML algorithm A (e.g., logistic regression), and a fairness specification (g, f, epsilon), OMNIFAIR will return a trained classifier h that maximizes  accuracy on D and, at the same time, ensures that, for any two groups g_i and g_j in D according to the grouping function g, the absolute difference between their fairness metric numbers according to the fairness_metric function f is within the disparity allowance epsilon.
                Figure 1 shows an example of constraint specification using our interface. Our interface can support not only  all common group fairness constraints but also customized ones, including customized grouping functions such as intersectional groups and customized fairness metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>2. Example Weighting for Model-Agnostic Property.</i> The main advantage of preprocessing techniques is that they can be used for any ML algorithm A. The model-agnostic property of preprocessing techniques is only possible when they limit the supported fairness constraints to those that do not involve both the prediction <code>h(x)</code> and the ground-truth label y (i.e., statistical parity). 
                Our system not only supports all constraints current in-processing techniques support,  but also does so in a model-agnostic way.
                Our key innovation to achieve the model-agnostic property is to translate the constrained optimization problem (i.e., maximizing for accuracy subject to fairness constraints) into a weighted unconstrained optimization problem (i.e., maximizing for weighted accuracy).
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>3. Supporting Multiple Fairness Constraints.</i> While existing fairness ML techniques already support fewer types of single group fairness constraints than OMNIFAIR.
                In practice, users may wish to enforce multiple fairness constraints simultaneously. While some in-processing techniques theoretically can support these cases, it is practically extremely difficult to do so, as each fairness constraint is hard-coded as part of the constrained optimization training process. 
                Our system can easily support multiple fairness constraints without any additional coding.

        Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in high-stakes applications impacting society. Therefore, it is of critical importance that ML models do not propagate discrimination. Collecting accurate labeled data in societal applications is challenging and costly. Active learning is a promising approach to build an accurate classifier by interactively querying an oracle within a labeling budget.
        We introduce the fair active learning framework to carefully select data points to be labeled so as to balance model accuracy and fairness.
        To incorporate the notion of fairness in the active learning sampling core, it is required to measure the fairness of the model after adding each unlabeled sample. Since their labels are unknown in advance, we propose an expected fairness metric to probabilistically measure the impact of each sample if added for each possible class label.
        Next, we propose multiple optimizations to balance the trade-off between accuracy and fairness.
        Our first optimization linearly aggregate the expected fairness with entropy using a control parameter. To avoid erroneous estimation of the expected fairness, we propose a nested approach to maintain the accuracy of the model, limiting the search space to the top bucket of sample points with large entropy. Finally, to ensure the unfairness reduction of the model after labeling, we propose to replicate the points that truly reduce the unfairness after labeling.
        We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms over widely used benchmark datasets using demographic parity and equalized odds notions of fairness.

            Data-driven decision making plays a significant role in modern societies by enabling wise decisions and to make societies more just, prosperous, inclusive, and safe. However, this comes with a great deal of responsibilities as improper development of data science technologies can not only fail but make matters worse. Judges in US courts, for example, use criminal assessment algorithms that are based on the  background information of individuals for setting bails or sentencing criminals. While it could potentially lead to safer societies, an improper usage could result in deleterious consequences on people's lives. For instance, the recidivism scores provided for the judges are highly criticized as being discriminatory, as they assign higher risks to African American individuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Machine learning (ML) is at the center of data-driven decision making as it provides insightful unseen information about phenomena based on available observations. Two major reasons of unfair outcome of ML models are Bias in training data and Proxy attributes. The former is mainly due to the inherent bias (discrimination) in the historical data that reflects unfairness in society. For example, redlining is a systematic denial of services used in the past against specific racial communities, affecting historical data records. Proxy attributes on the other hand, are often used due to the limited access to labeled data, especially when it comes to societal applications. For example, when actual future recidivism records of individuals are not available, one may resort to information such as ``prior arrests'' that are easy to collect and use it as a proxy for the true labels, albeit a discriminatory one.
          </p>
          <p>
            A new paradigm of fairness in machine learning has emerged to address the unfairness issues of predictive outcomes. These work often assume the availability of (possibly biased) labeled data in sufficient quantity. When this assumption is violated, their performance degrades. In many practical societal applications one operates in a constrained environment. Obtaining accurate labeled data is expensive, and could only be obtained in a limited amount. Training the model by using the (problematic) proxy attribute as the true label will result in an unfair model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to develop efficient and effective algorithms for fair models in an environment where the budget for labeled data is restricted. An obvious baseline is to randomly select a subset of data (depending on the available budget), obtain their labels, and use it for training. However, a more sophisticated approach would be to use an adaptive sampling strategy. Active learning is a widely used strategy for such a scenario. It sequentially chooses the unlabeled instances where their labeling is the most beneficial for the performance improvement of the ML model.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this paper, we develop an active learning framework that will yield fair(er) models. Fairness has different definitions and is measurable in various ways. Specifically, we consider a model fair if its outcome does not depend
            on sensitive attributes such as race or gender.

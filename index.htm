		<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
		<p>Hi. My name is Abolfazl (Ab) Asudeh. I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the<a target="_blank" href="http://cse.uta.edu"> department of Computer Science
		</a>at <a href="http://www.uta.edu">the University of 
		Texas at Arlington</a>. I am very fortunate to have Prof.
		<a target="_blank" href="http://ranger.uta.edu/~gdas/">Gautam Das</a> as my Ph.D. advisor, and to be a member of <a target="_blank" href="http://dbxlab.uta.edu/">DBXLAB</a>.
		I have also worked with Prof. <a target="_blank" href="http://crystal.uta.edu/~zaruba/">Gergely Zaruba</a>
		<!-- and Dr. 
		<a target="_parent" target="_blank" href="http://ranger.uta.edu/~cli/">Chengkai Li</a>, when I was a member of
		<a target="_blank" href="https://idir.uta.edu/index.php/Main_Page">IDIR</a> Lab-->.
		I received my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering - 
		Software&nbsp; from the <a target="_blank" href="http://ce.sharif.edu/">Computer Engineering department</a> at
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sharif.edu/web/en">Sharif University of 
		Technology</a> under the supervision of Dr. 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://sharif.edu/~movaghar/">Ali Movaghar</a> in 2008. Before joining UTA, I 
		had the chance of teaching the computer science courses at several universities of Iran, from 2008 to 2011.<br />
		<!--During the previous summer (Summer 2014) I was at Seattle, Wa Interning at Microsoft. -->
            I have a broad area of research interests, including Big Data Exploration and Hidden Databases, Crowdsourcing and Human Computation, (Knowledge) Graph Mining, and (Sensor) Network Algorithms.<br />
            More info @ <a target="_blank" href="cv_2.pdf">my CV</a>.
